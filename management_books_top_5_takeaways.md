Top 5 management reminders from notable people management / business books

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scaling People by Claire Hughes Johnson](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-People-Tactics-Management-Building/dp/1953953212)[^management_books_top_5_takeaways-1]

[^management_books_top_5_takeaways-1]: [Claire's podcast with Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2024/02/27/claire-hughes-johnson-transcript/)

1.  Managers who under-delegate = involved in and review everything; progress stalls when they're OOO

2.  Managers who over-delegate = too far removed from the work; reports overwhelmed/overstretched

3.  Over-shielding the team can limit growth opportunities and important work visibility

4.  Feedback: make it specific, be clear on success, did it resonate, questioning to align on next steps

5.  Help folks explore solutions vs telling them what to do (use phrasing like "let's explore this together")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Making of a Manager by Julie Zhuo](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567)

1.  Manager assessment dimensions: A) outcomes/results B) team member development

2.  Three key management levers: purpose (why), people (who), process (how)

3.  Relationships: not conditional on most recent wins; folks proactively share work vulnerabilities

4.  Give more feedback: 50/50 positive vs constructive; feedback counts if it makes things better

5.  Strong team leadership signal = progress continues (does not stall) when you go on extended vacation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Coaching Habit by Michael Bungay Stanier](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749)

1.  Ask more, tell less (stopping be so quick to give advice and ask more questions)

2.  "Why" questions framed as “What” questions tend to feel less threatening

3.  1-on-1s opening question: what's on your mind?

4.  Coaching opportunity setup: what's the real challenge for you here? How can I help?

5.  Coaching wrap up question: what was most useful for you?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756)

[dysfunction =\> counter measure]

1.  Absence of trust =\> leader must first demonstrate genuine vulnerability

2.  Fear of conflict =\> encourage healthy debates on thorny topics

3.  Lack of commitment =\> gather input from across the team then be decisive vs consensus seeking

4.  Avoidance of accountability =\> make commitments visible and have high expectations for each other

5.  Inattention to results =\> focus on collective company wins vs department/individual wins

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[No Rules Rules by Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer](https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Rules-Netflix-Transformation/dp/1984877860)

1.  Lead with context (why) vs control (how)

2.  Default to trust and ownership (i.e. [Netflix vacation policy is two words](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture): "Take vacation.")

3.  Emphasize sustained "A" performance, not the number of hours worked or how hard someone works

4.  Top performers want to work on teams with high talent density (which pushes them to be better)

5.  Don't spin: people can detect it (which erodes trust and makes you look like a fraud)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)

1.  Manager output = output of their team + the output of the neighboring teams under their influence

2.  How to improve an employee's output? training (coaching) and motivation

3.  As employee task maturity increases: supervision/review shifts from close/consistent to loose/variable

4.  If there's a choice, delegate tasks with higher manager familiarity due to reviewing/coaching efficiency

5.  Values and behavioral norms are most effectively communicated by doing and doing visibly

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Trillion Dollar Coach by Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, and Alan Eagle](https://www.amazon.com/Trillion-Dollar-Coach-Leadership-Playbook/dp/0062839268)

1.  You can't be a great manager/leader if you're not a great coach

2.  Important aspect of coaching: constant encouragement + being a person to give energy

3.  Helping the team win has to come before personal career optimization

4.  Equally or more important than the results delivered is how the results were achieved and with whom

5.  Act live an owner: take off department hat and put on company hat to guide decision making

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Radical Candor by Kim Scott](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Kick-Ass-Humanity-ebook/dp/B07P9LPXPT)

1.  Radical Candor = care personally + challenge directly

2.  Holding back or spinning feedback because you don't want to hurt feelings doesn't help folks longterm

3.  Keep at least 3 unimportant things unsaid per day; Radical Candor is not nitpicking

4.  Feedback clarity: describe what was good and/or bad to encourage more or less of it in the future

5.  Publicly reward getting challenged and corrected by directs to normalize the behavior and make it safe
